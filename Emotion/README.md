Artificial Emotional Intelligence or Emotion AI is a branch of AI that allow computers to understand human non-verbal cues such as body language and facial expressions.


## Objetive
Classify people’s emotions based on their face images.

## Data
The team of a startup has collected more than 20000 facial images, with their associated facial expression labels and around 2000 images with their facial key-point annotations.

#### **Dataset 1**
- Dataset of x and y coordinates of 15 The consists facial key points.
- Input Images are 96 x 96 pixels.
- Images consist of only one color channel (gray-scale images).  

#### **Dataset 2**
The second model will classify people’s emotion. Data contains images that belong to 5 categories:
- 0 = Angry
- 1 = Disgust
- 2 = Sad
- 3 = Happy
- 4 = Surprise


## Methodology
- Facial Key Points Detection Model _(Convolutional Neural Network and Residual Blocks)_
- Facial Expression (emotion) detection model _(Artificial Neural Network)_
